# live_search_suggestion
Live database search functionality. Built with Node.JS (express.js) and MongoDB (mongoose).

The way it basically works is that on every key release, we send a fetch post request, to the '/fruitSearch' route, and send the values back.
We use regex to make sure only a desired query value will be sent, and queried in the database.
